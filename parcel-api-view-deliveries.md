The best delivery tracking app. 
Parcel API - Recent & Active Deliveries 
**Intended Usage** This API endpoint was developed to allow premium users to see their **upcoming and active** deliveries on other devices and platforms (e.g. Home Assistant). It was not designed to serve as a full replacement of the app, hence its limited functionality. 
**Expected Poll Rate** Calling this endpoint does not trigger an update to your deliveries, you always get a cached response from the app server with this API. The rate limit is 20 requests per hour. 
**Authorization** API key can be generated at [web.parcelapp.net](https://web.parcelapp.net). The key should be supplied in the HTTP header "api-key". 
**Endpoint** URL: https://api.parcel.app/external/deliveries/ 
**Path Parameters** filter_mode (optional). Possible values: "active", "recent". Default": "recent". 
**Example Request** `curl "https://api.parcel.app/external/deliveries/?filter_mode=active" -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"`
